Summary:
Automatically shuts oDoor1 after an set amount of time. If oDoor1 is
connected to oDoor2 via a transition, it will close oDoor2 at the same time.
By default, doors close after 30 seconds, however you can override this by
setting a local float variable on the door called AUTO_SHUT_DELAY.
If AUTO_SHUT_DELAY equals -1.0, the door will never auto close.
